/**
* For the brave souls who get this far: You are the chosen ones,
* the valiant knights of programming who toil away, without rest,
* fixing our most awful code. To you, true saviors, kings of men,
* I say this: never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down,
* never gonna run around and desert you. Never gonna make you cry,
* never gonna say goodbye. Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.

// Dear maintainer:
//
// Once you are done trying to 'optimize' this routine,
// and have realized what a terrible mistake that was,
// please increment the following counter as a warning
// to the next guy:
//
// total_hours_wasted_here = 25
//
```

```
//When I wrote this, only God and I understood what I was doing
//Now, God only knows

// drunk, fix later

// Magic. Do not touch.

// I'm sorry.
```

```
/*
 * You may think you know what the following code does.
 * But you dont. Trust me.
 * Fiddle with it, and youll spend many a sleepless
 * night cursing the moment you thought youd be clever
 * enough to "optimize" the code below.
 * Now close this file and go play with something else.

//I am not sure why this works but it fixes the problem.

```
// I am not sure if we need this, but too scared to delete.
```

```
//Dear future me. Please forgive me.
//I can't even begin to express how sorry I am.
```

```
// I am not responsible of this code.
// They made me write it, against my will.
```

```
// I have to find a better job
```

```
// TODO: Fix this.  Fix what?
// Any maintenance developer who can't quote entire Monty Python
// movies from memory has no business being a developer.

// Catching exceptions is for communists

// TODO make this work
