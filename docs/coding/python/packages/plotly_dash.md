![](img/dash.svg){.center width="60.0%"}

[Plotly Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/) The world's most trusted framework for building ML and data science web apps.

Dash empowers teams to build data science and ML apps that put the power of Python, R, and Julia in the hands of business users. Full stack apps that would typically require a front-end, backend, and dev ops team can now be built and deployed in hours by data scientists with Dash.
